                                Lionel Messi Reaches New International Milestone in Argentina's Victory Over Angola
                            </p>

                            <p class="spacing">
                                In Argentina’s 2–0 win against Angola at the Estádio 11 de Novembro, Lionel Messi
                                recorded both a goal and an assist, marking another milestone in his international
                                career. The assist, delivered to Lautaro Martínez in the 43rd minute, represents Messi’s
                                ninth career assist to the Inter striker, matching his record for the most assists to a
                                single teammate, a mark he previously reached with Gonzalo Higuaín and Sergio Agüero
                                (Langell).
                            </p>

                            <p class="spacing">
                                Just one more assist to Martínez would set Messi apart, adding another record to his
                                illustrious career, which already includes consecutive Copa América titles and the 2022
                                FIFA World Cup victory (Langell).
                            </p>

                            <p class="spacing">
                                Messi, who has now scored 115 goals in 187 appearances for Argentina, will need to wait
                                until the new year to attempt to surpass his personal record for assists, after
                                Argentina’s friendly with Australia scheduled for November 17 was postponed. Despite
                                only appearing once during the November international window, Messi’s performance was
                                historic: he both assisted Martínez and scored his 115th international goal in the 82nd
                                minute (Langell).
                            </p>

                            <p class="spacing">
                                Following the international break, Messi will shift focus to Inter Miami as the club
                                aims for its first MLS Cup. Inter Miami advanced past Nashville SC in the opening round
                                of the 2025 MLS Cup playoffs and will face FC Cincinnati in the Eastern Conference
                                semifinals on November 23. With 20 goal contributions in his last eight matches across
                                club and country, Messi is expected to play a pivotal role in leading Inter Miami to
                                their first-ever conference final and potentially earning back-to-back MLS MVP honors
                                (Langell).

                            <p class="spacing">
                                Soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world, and there are plenty of cool
                                facts that most players and fans might not know. Even though the rules look simple, the
                                history and details behind the game are full of interesting surprises. From
                                record-breaking players to unusual traditions, soccer has grown into a sport that brings
                                millions of people together.
                            </p>

                            <p class="spacing">
                                One of the craziest facts about soccer is how massive the FIFA World Cup actually was.
                                There were more than 3 billion people who watched the 2022 World Cup — that’s almost
                                half of everyone on the planet! The final between Argentina and France alone had over a
                                billion viewers. This makes the World Cup the single most-watched sporting event in the
                                whole world, even bigger than the Olympics.
                            </p>

                            <p class="spacing">
                                Another fun fact is that soccer fields aren’t all exactly the same size. The rules allow
                                fields to be anywhere between 100–130 yards long and 50–100 yards wide. Coaches even
                                choose strategies based on the size of the field, which can make a big difference in how
                                the game feels.
                            </p>

                            <p class="spacing">
                                Some players have also made unforgettable records. For example, Cristiano Ronaldo is the
                                first male player to score over 120 international goals, while Lionel Messi has won the
                                most Ballon d'Or awards, with eight wins. Watching these two legends play at the same
                                time is something future generations might never see again.
                            </p>

                            <p class="spacing">
                                Soccer even has some weird rules and traditions. For example, the referee’s whistle was
                                not always used. Before whistles were invented, referees raised a handkerchief to stop
                                the game! Another unusual rule is that a goalkeeper can be given a yellow card for
                                wasting too much time. Rules like these keep the game fair and fast-paced.
                            </p>

                            <p class="spacing">
                                Finally, soccer balls haven’t always looked the way they do now. The classic
                                black-and-white pattern was designed in 1970 so the ball would be easier to see on
                                black-and-white TV broadcasts. Today, balls are made with advanced materials that help
                                them fly straighter, reduce the weight, and go even faster. Modern designs are tested
                                using wind tunnels, computer simulations, and even some robots that kick the ball with
                                perfect accuracy.

                                Many people know famous football players like Mo Salah, Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, or
                                great coaches like Jürgen Klopp. But not many know about the data analysts who help
                                teams win from behind the scenes. These people study numbers, videos, and player
                                movements to help coaches make smart decisions.
                            </p>

                                Football clubs today collect huge amounts of information every time players train or
                                play a match. Cameras and GPS trackers record how fast players run, where they move,
                                when they pass, shoot, or tackle. Experts say that more than 2,000 pieces of data are
                                recorded in every match, plus 1.5 million tracking points about player movements.
                            </p>

                            <p class="spacing">
                                One of the best-known data experts is Ian Graham, who leads the data department at
                                Liverpool FC. His team helps clubs sign great players and build strong tactics using
                                smart data analysis.
                            </p>

                            <p class="spacing">
                                Graham and his team use formulas like “goal probability added” to evaluate each player’s
                                impact on scoring chances. This helps teams find underrated players who are better than
                                they first appear.

                                Liverpool isn’t the only club investing in data experts. Manchester City also hires top
                                scientists, including those from Harvard or even government work, to stay ahead.
