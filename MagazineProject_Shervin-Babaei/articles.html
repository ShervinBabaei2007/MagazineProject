                                    Lionel Messi Reaches New International Milestone in Argentina's Victory Over Angola
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    In Argentina’s 2–0 win against Angola at the Estádio 11 de Novembro, Lionel Messi
                                    recorded both a goal and an assist, marking another milestone in his international
                                    career. The assist, delivered to Lautaro Martínez in the 43rd minute, represents
                                    Messi’s ninth career assist to the Inter striker, matching his record for the most
                                    assists to a single teammate, a mark he previously reached with Gonzalo Higuaín and
                                    Sergio Agüero (Langell) (Langell).
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Just one more assist to Martínez would set Messi apart, adding another record to his
                                    illustrious career, which already includes consecutive Copa América titles and the
                                    2022 FIFA World Cup victory (Langell).
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Messi, who has now scored 115 goals in 187 appearances for Argentina, will need to
                                    wait until the new year to attempt to surpass his personal record for assists, after
                                    Argentina’s friendly with Australia scheduled for November 17 was postponed. Despite
                                    only appearing once during the November international window, Messi’s performance
                                    was historic: he both assisted Martínez and scored his 115th international goal in
                                    the 82nd minute (Langell).
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Following the international break, Messi will shift focus to Inter Miami as the club
                                    aims for its first MLS Cup. Inter Miami advanced past Nashville SC in the opening
                                    round of the 2025 MLS Cup playoffs and will face FC Cincinnati in the Eastern
                                    Conference semifinals on November 23. With 20 goal contributions in his last eight
                                    matches across club and country, Messi is expected to play a pivotal role in leading
                                    Inter Miami to their first-ever conference final and potentially earning
                                    back-to-back MLS MVP honors (Langell).
