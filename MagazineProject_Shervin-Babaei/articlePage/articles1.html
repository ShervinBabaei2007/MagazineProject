                Lionel Messi Reaches New International Milestone in Argentina's Victory Over Angola
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                In Argentina’s 2–0 win against Angola at the Estádio 11 de Novembro, Lionel Messi recorded both a goal
                and an assist, marking another milestone in his international career. The assist, delivered to Lautaro
                Martínez in the 43rd minute, represents Messi’s ninth career assist to the Inter striker, matching his
                record for the most assists to a single teammate, a mark he previously reached with Gonzalo Higuaín and
                Sergio Agüero (Langell).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Just one more assist to Martínez would set Messi apart, adding another record to his illustrious career,
                which already includes consecutive Copa América titles and the 2022 FIFA World Cup victory (Langell).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Messi, who has now scored 115 goals in 187 appearances for Argentina, will need to wait until the new
                year to attempt to surpass his personal record for assists, after Argentina’s friendly with Australia
                scheduled for November 17 was postponed. Despite only appearing once during the November international
                window, Messi’s performance was historic: he both assisted Martínez and scored his 115th international
                goal in the 82nd minute (Langell).
              </p>

              <p class="spacing">
                Following the international break, Messi will shift focus to Inter Miami as the club aims for its first
                MLS Cup. Inter Miami advanced past Nashville SC in the opening round of the 2025 MLS Cup playoffs and
                will face FC Cincinnati in the Eastern Conference semifinals on November 23. With 20 goal contributions
                in his last eight matches across club and country, Messi is expected to play a pivotal role in leading
                Inter Miami to their first-ever conference final and potentially earning back-to-back MLS MVP honors
                (Langell).
